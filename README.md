# All Around AWS IaCs

This is a semi-workshop semi-list of things I've discovered and noted during my long long experience working with CloudFormation, SAM and recently CDK.
I write them down as soon as I get time, I do not follow any specific structure except the sturcture of root directories. Chapters are sorted in an order of delivery, I just dump them as is.

Pull requests are welcome!

## What's inside

3 root directories: CloudFormation, SAM and CDK. Inside each IaC's chapter there is a README.md with explanation and example code.
Simple as that.

## Table of Contents
